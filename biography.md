I am the Director of Open Source at Indeed, and a Visting Technologist Fellow at the [National Security Institute](https://nationalsecurity.gmu.edu/fellows/). As the Director of Open Source at Indeed, I have led our efforts to inventory, analyze, and understand our open source dependencies - from single-file JavaScript libraries to fundamental pieces of our digital infrastructure. My team's work has defined Indeed's strategic approach to direct-investment in the people, projects, and foundations at the heart of open source. This work includes the [FOSS Contributor Fund blueprint](https://github.com/indeedeng/FOSS-Contributor-Fund) that we shared with the community, our industry-leading work to directly sponsor individual contributors through the [GitHub Sponsors program](https://github.com/orgs/indeedeng/sponsoring), our broad engagement across the open source foundation ecosystem, and our participation in various working groups. Prior to my time at Indeed, I led operations for the Open Source Program Office at PayPal, and have worked as a developer at Adobe, Autodesk, and others.
